Code to create a chess game

## Current state of code:
1. chess_main handles user inputs, displays board.
2. chess_engine stores state data for the game, calcuates valid moves and move log.

## Improvements to be made

1. Also check mating doesn't display properly
2. Adding a machine learning engine that allows you to play the computer.
3. Alternative version of chess_main for online version - the engine can be the same.


## Bugs
### Checks

1. Can enpassant into check
2. Can move pinned queen into check

## Other

1. No castling
