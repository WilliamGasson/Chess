Code to create a chess game

## Current state of code:
1. chess_main handles user inputs, displays board.
2. chess_engine stores state data for the game, calcuates valid moves and move log.

## Improvements to be made
1. Adding enpassen / pawn promotion / castling need to be added.
2. Also checking and check mating don't work properly
3. Adding a machine learning engine that allows you to play the computer.
4. Alternative version of chess_main for online version - the engine can be the same.


## Bugs
### Checks
1. seems to be in check from its own knights
2. Can move king towards checking piece
3. Can enpassant into check

## Other

1. No castling
